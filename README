This is The CHAOS MONKEY.  It will kill your processes.

"What kills you, makes you stronger" -- The Chaos Monkey

Start by including the chaos_monkey amongst your applications.  The
Chaos Monkey stays in his cage and eats bananas by default.  Let it
out by running chaos_monkey:on() or have him kill a single process
using chaos_monkey:kill().


chaos_monkey:find_orphans() -> [Pid]

  The Chaos Monkey smell processes and find the ones which don't have
  the protection of an application.  It gladly hands them over to you
  to do with them as you please.


chaos_monkey:on() -> {ok, started} | {error, already_running}
chaos_monkey:off() -> {ok, stopped} | {error, not_running}

  Asynchronous.

  Will let The Chaos Monkey wreck reasonable havoc over time on your
  system.  This is the command to use if you want The Chaos Monkey
  running all the time.

  It will stay away from system processes and supervisors like a good
  monkey.

chaos_monkey:havoc() ->
    {ok, NumberOfKilledProcesses} | {error, Error}
chaos_monkey:havoc(Applications) ->
    {ok, NumberOfKilledProcesses} | {error, Error}
chaos_monkey:havoc(Applications, Protected) ->
    {ok, NumberOfKilledProcesses} | {error, Error}

  Types:

    Applications :: all | all_but_otp | all_but_deps | [application()]
    Protected :: [pid() | registered_name()]
    NumberOfKilledProcesses :: non_neg_integer()
    Error :: term()

  NOT IMPLEMENTED YET

  Synchronous.

  The Chaos Monkey will randomly walk through processes belonging to
  the list of applications and kill everything a couple of times.
  Supervisors are too strong for The Chaos Monkey, so it will kill
  their children instead aiming to kill by going above the restart
  threshold.  The Chaos Monkey is not suicidal so it will respect
  restart thresholds of permanent top level supervisors.

  As well as not killing supervisors, system processes and processes
  in the kernel application are too strong.  As mentioned above The
  Chaos Monkey is also not suicidal.  On top of this, the caller can
  specify an optional list of Protected processes.  These can be
  specified by name or pid.

  The Applications argument, tells The Chaos Monkey to focus its
  killing spree on:

    all -- All applications are available for killing.

    all_but_otp -- The Chaos Monkey will stay away from applications
                   in OTP.  Everything else is fair bait.  Default.

    [ListOfApps] -- Sic The Chaos Monkey on the list of application.
                    Remember that the Monkey will always see lonesome
                    processes that don't have the protection of an
                    application as available for harassment.

kill() -> {ok, ProcData}.

  Kills a single random process in your system.

  ProcData contains information about the process that was killed.
